Within every season of my life, my identity at that time is fundamentally influenced by the art that surrounds me.
My thoughts, perspective, and behaviors are cultivated by the art I consume. I don't think that I am unique in this
fact, either. Each of us are influenced by art in one way or another. Creation and consumption are fundamental to us
as Humans. So in an attempt to better understand and guide the things I create, I'd like to make a habit of reflecting
on the notable pieces I consume.

### Art

Let's start this off with a bang. In the past, I believe I have been quick to discredit an artist that had
one or only a handful of exceptional pieces. An artist in desperate pursuit of something new that would
rival their masterpiece, repeatedly falling short. The reality is that most artists orchestrate only one
masterpiece within a lifetime, if any at all. Every person is limited to a finite number of great achievements
or moments. To create something special in any capacity is an extraordinary feat. However, there are some artists
that exceed the expectation of only a handful of exceptional pieces. I find myself deeply inspired by the artist
who shattered the expectation of creative limitation entirely.

<br />

**Pietà (1498-1499, Vatican City) - Michelangelo**

An utter masterpiece. Sculpted by 23 year old Michelangelo, the sculpture
depicts virgin Mary holding her son Jesus in arms after being taken down from
the cross. "Pietà", meaning "pity" or "compassion", rests in St. Peter's
Basilica, Vatican City, the location it was originally intended for. It is
astounding to think that Michelangelo was able to free this divine depiction
from a slab of marble. The lower right picture, although doing little justice to
the work, was taken by me in 2022 while studying abroad in Italy.

**David (1501-1504, Florence) - Michelangelo**

Beginning at age 26, Michelangelo produces perhaps the most impressive sculpture
of all time.

<br />

**The Creation of Adam (1508-1512, Vatican City) - Michelangelo**

And just when we thought Michelangelo was a master sculpture alone, he bolsters
his legacy as the greatest artist of all time by painting one of the most sacred
pieces of art in western history. Depicting the Biblical story of creation from
the book of Genesis, The Creation of Adam forms a portion of the Sistine
Chapel's ceiling painted by Michelangelo between the ages of 33 and 37.
