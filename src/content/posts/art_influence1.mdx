I find that with each passing season of my life, my identity is fundamentally influenced by the art surrounding me.
My perspective on and behavior in life are cultivated by the art I consume. I don't think that I am alone in this either. Each of us is influenced by art in one way or another, whether a movie, or album, or whatever else. Creation and consumption are fundamental to us
as Humans. So in an attempt to better understand and guide the things I create, I'd like to make a habit of reflecting
on the notable pieces I consume.

### Art

Let's start this off with a bang. In the past, I believe I've been quick to discredit an artist with
one or only a handful of exceptional pieces. An artist in desperate pursuit of creating something new to
rival their masterpiece, repeatedly falling short seemed unimpressive. The reality is that most artists orchestrate only one
masterpiece within a lifetime, if any at all. Every person is limited to a finite number of great achievements. To create something special in any capacity is an extraordinary feat. However, there are some artists
that exceed the expectation of only a handful of exceptional pieces. I find myself deeply inspired by the artist
who shattered the expectation of creative limitation entirely.

<br />

**Pietà (1498-1499, Vatican City) - Michelangelo**

Truly a masterpiece. Sculpted by 23 year old Michelangelo, the sculpture
depicts virgin Mary holding her son Jesus in arms after being taken down from
the cross. "Pietà", meaning "pity" or "compassion", rests in St. Peter's
Basilica, Vatican City, the location it was originally intended for. It is
astounding to think that Michelangelo was able to free this divine depiction
from a slab of marble. The lower right picture, although doing little justice to
the work, was taken by me in 2022 while studying abroad in Italy.

<br />

**David (1501-1504, Florence) - Michelangelo**

Beginning at age 26, Michelangelo produces perhaps the most impressive sculpture
of all time. His statue of David helped propel him to the great fame and
recognition he enjoyed during his lifetime. His artwork was so impressive that
his contemporaries went as far as to call him "Il Divino", or "The Divine One".
Incredible.

<br />

**The Creation of Adam (1508-1512, Vatican City) - Michelangelo**

And just when we thought Michelangelo was a master sculpture alone, he bolsters
his legacy as the greatest artist of all time by painting one of the most sacred
pieces of art in western history. Depicting the Biblical story of creation from
the book of Genesis, The Creation of Adam forms a portion of the Sistine
Chapel's ceiling painted by Michelangelo between the ages of 33 and 37.

### Television

I'm usually not one to watch much tv. In fact, I've only finished a handful of tv series (on second thought, maybe none at all).
Maybe it's time for this to change...

**Severance, Season 1 (2022)**
