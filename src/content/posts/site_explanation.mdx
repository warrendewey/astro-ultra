From mid 2024 up until now, early 2025, I have come to terms with the fact that our world is becoming increasingly set within the digital world.
Production of media, products, and services takes place digitally in an overwhelming amount as physical production slows. With that, I want to use this personal website as a way to experiment with digital creation and projects. I plan to keep it low stakes and light-hearted, while also developing skills applicable to the modern world.
